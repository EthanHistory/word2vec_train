------------------


Nooks is a platform **transforming sales reps from manual laborers to scientists**. With today's technology, sales reps shouldn't need to manually write hundreds of emails, research hundreds of websites/linkedins, and make hundreds of calls. They should instead **focus on the parts of their job that actually require people** - talking to customers, being creative, and problem-solving. With a combination of AI tools, automation and real-time collaboration, Nooks can do the rest.


**About Nooks**
---------------


* **The team:** Nooks is ~30 people. Engineering & product are mostly in SF and go to our office 2-3x/week. The go-to-market team is distributed across the U.S.
	+ The founders (Dan, Rohan, and Nikhil) met studying AI at Stanford, have published in top AI journals, Forbes 30u30, worked at Scale AI, Tesla Autopilot, etc.
	+ The engineering team has won international math & physics olympiads, has experience at Google, Facebook, Slack, Quora, Scale AI, Bolt, Snap, Flexport, and other fast-growing startups.
	+ The sales team have been top-performers at companies like Gong, Amplitude, LeadIQ, and Orum.
* **Fast growth:** We've grown $0 >$3M ARR in 20 months. We grew 4x in 2023 and expect to 3x by EOY 2024.


**The problem**
---------------


Sales pipeline is critical for growing companies. Many, especially B2B companies, have teams of sales/business development representatives (SDR/BDRs) or full-cycle account executives whose responsibility is to identify, contact, and qualify new potential customers. There are ~750,000 SDR/BDR's in the US alone (e.g. Airtable (https://boards.greenhouse.io/airtable/jobs/6744435002), Brex (https://www.brex.com/careers/6850017002), Databricks (https://www.databricks.com/company/careers/sales-development/business-development-representative-6933516002) and many other tech companies have sizable SDR/BDR teams)


In their day-to-day, SDR/BDRs spend time on 3 main activities:


* Prospecting & research - identify a list of potential customers using signals like industry, size, fundraising, headcount growth, new hires, job descriptions, etc.
* Email & LinkedIn messaging - write messages to those contacts to convey the problem and pitch your product. The goal is for them to book a demo
* Calling - Live phone conversations often have higher conversion than emails because they're more personal, but there's a lot more manual work involved


### ***Most of the sales rep's job can be automated with today's technology: large language models, web scraping, automation, integrations, etc.***


**Nooks today**
---------------

  

Our customers use Nooks for most of their day (avg ~3hrs/business day). Nooks currently owns end-to-end workflows around sales calls:


* AI dialer - automates the manual parts of the calling process: skipping answering machines, leaving voicemails, taking notes, logging calls, even figuring out what to say on a call
* Analytics - we record, transcribe, and analyze every call. Since these are all outbound calls with little context, these calls follow similar structure - opener, pitch, questions/objections, ask for meeting, etc. So we can answer questions like: “which reps struggle to book the meeting with prospects who showed interest” or “what are the most common objections across each of our key personas”
* Salesfloor - sales reps & managers can work together throughout the day, listen to each others' calls, give real-time advice, coaching, shadowing, onboarding, training.


Teams that use Nooks often see a 2-3x increase in reps' productivity within weeks! And we're working on adding prospecting / research workflows (to-be-announced soon!)


(https://app.nooks.in/demoroom)


### **The role**


Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience


We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. We're hiring our first Machine Learning Engineer. This is a role focused on implementing ML features into Nooks. Our ideal candidate will have prior experience working in industry for a business where ML is a core part of the offering.


Responsibilities will include training production models to improve their accuracy for specific sales use cases. You will align our technical strategy with performance, cost and feasibility considerations.


### **Examples of engineering problems you may touch**


### ***These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don't need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!***


* **Realtime audio AI & precision/recall/latency tradeoffs (algorithms & models)**
	+ We use audio data, transcription, silence detection, and several other signals to detect whether a live phone call is a voicemail, a human, or a dial tree. Here, latency is a third factor added to the standard precision/recall tradeoff because it's important we can detect humans quickly. Our approach involves LLM embeddings, few-shot learning, data labeling, and continuous monitoring of model performance in prod.
* **Smart call funnels & playbooks (data wrangling, backend eng, GPT-3, UX)**
	+ At what point in the conversation do my reps get stuck? What are the toughest questions that we need to address? Can I “program” a playbook so that Nooks will help my team standardize toward best-practices? We're using GPT-3 and other LLM's to turn companies' mostly unstructured call data into actionable strategies & feedback loops.
* **Conversation embeddings & markov models (ML modeling)**
	+ What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what do I say next to maximize the likelihood that I book a demo at the end of the call? Can we use LLM's to generate embeddings of conversations that we can use to cluster similar conversation patterns and predict where the conversation is headed?


**Requirements**
----------------


* Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
* 3+ years of industry experience, including 2+ years training and deploying ML models in production.
* Full stack ML Eng chops: proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn etc.
* Expertise in areas like NLP, Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection, Transformers and Large Language Models.


Nice to haves:


* Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
* Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments

Primordial Labs is building Anura, the next-generation human-machine interface. Anura allows operators to command, control and collaborate with uncrewed systems through natural language, just like they would with a human teammate. Our job is to make it easier for warfighters to wield the power of autonomous systems on the battlefield.


### **Job Description:**


(Please Note: This is a 100% remote position that requires residence in the United States.)


We're looking for machine learning engineers with a background in natural language processing. Candidates with expertise in any of the following areas are highly desirable:


* Natural language understanding
* Dialog state tracking
* Natural language generation
* Speech-to-text & text-to-speech algorithms
* Strategies for optimizing and deploying transformer networks on embedded devices


As a company co-founded and led by engineers, we are focused on developer experience. We promise to minimize distractions (read: meetings) and to provide tools which maximize productivity. We are also committed to providing competitive total compensation, including profit sharing.


### **What You'll Do:**


We are a small company, so you can expect to be an integral part of all phases of product development. Including lots and lots of flight testing. Here are a few examples of how you'll contribute to the development of Anura:


* Improve the robustness of our offline speech-to-text engine so it can operate in extremely cluttered environments.
* Infer drone operator's intent and integrate with our AI decision making and platform/sensor control engines.
* Support the design and implementation of our upcoming tactical dialog state tracking system.


### **About You:**


There are no educational requirements. We're more interested in projects you've worked on - both on the job and on the side. So please be prepared to discuss those! The ideal candidate will have excellent Python skills and be adept in at least one ML framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).


### **Application Process:**


We have a two-stage interview process.  

  



The first stage is a screener which is a combination of technical discussion about relevant engineering concepts as well as your past experience. This screener is generally around 30 minutes.

  

After the screener, if both sides believe it makes sense, we will provide you with an 'offline' coding test. This test is done on your own time, at your own pace, so you do not feel the pressure of coding live with us watching. We want you to do your best with a clear mind and free of interview jitters. The questions are a combination of algorithm and system design. Once you complete the test, we'll all hop back on another call and you will walk us through your code. We are not just looking for the right answers, we're interested in your thought processes and technical approach.

  

We are committed to a low-stress interview experience and promise there will be no trick questions or brain teasers!",https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/W-EI_IE2709790.htm,,,,,,,,,,,Machine Learning Engineer,2024-04-14

While we’re open to all candidates, we’re not offering any relocation benefits at this time (sad face). All new teammates will be subject to a background check and drug screening, which results won’t necessarily affect employment opportunities.

* *Financial stability*. Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities.

  

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet.

* We offer excellent insurance packages, including medical, dental, and vision plans; company-paid life insurance; company-paid long- and short-term disability insurance; and medical and dependent-care flexible spending plans.
* We provide a flexible time off (FTO) program; E Source employees can take as many paid days off per year as they need, with manager approval, while fulfilling their work obligations and ensuring proper coverage of their responsibilities.
* We offer flexible schedules, flexible work locations, and a paid parental leave benefit.
* We provide a 401(k)/RRSP with a 3% employer match.

**About Invisible:**



Invisible Technologies is dedicated to fusing human creativity and intuition with cutting-edge technology to create a future rich in impact and meaning. We firmly believe that human involvement is essential in unlocking the full potential of AI, ensuring it is developed with greater accuracy, quality, safety, reliability, and fairness. This human-centric approach underpins our unique process orchestration engine, a platform that merges artificial and human intelligence with automation to remove operational bottlenecks and pave the way for growth and innovation in our clients.


**The Business Context**



You already use AI in many ways—like deciding what products and services to order—and it may be most familiar to you as a chatbot, as an avatar-maker, or as a way to unlock your screen. But here's what AI may be able to help the world with: finding medical diagnoses, teaching you about scientific research, and calculating the complexities of any function.



But, like humans, AI models are what they eat. They're only as good as the rules they know and the data they're trained on. We're the team that helps shape these behaviors.


**The Work**


**This work specifically involves exposure to varying kinds of sensitive and explicit content, via text and possibly image. This may include, but not be limited to, written depictions of sexual content, violence, and medical content. There will also be work involving representational bias.**



Safety AI Data Training work is for the purposes of improving model alignment against safety standards and user policies. Our goal is to protect a wider audience from harm while creating a supportive and sustainable environment for those engaging in this important work.



These tasks call for a great deal of cognitive flexibility and creativity. These tasks will require both a) generating data through complex prompt engineering and b) reviewing and annotating that data.



Support Provided:


* Access to our mental health support platform providing therapy, emergency counseling, and crisis support
* Regular check-ins
* Wellness surveys
* Opt out with the possibility of paid alternatives

This is a technology job that relies more fully on your *competencies* than your formal experience. You're the sort of person who is exceptional at both generating and editing copy. You've also got the metacognitive awareness to ""show your work."" In addition, you've cultivated a deep interest in linguistics and unwavering curiosity. You know how to both read between the lines and pattern-spot. You instinctively document learning and continuously refine methods. Ideally, you've spent a great deal of time already playing with language models, and you consider yourself to be a casual prompt engineer.



You are a(n):


* Individual that is comfortable being exposed to sensitive or explicit content
* Exceptional writer and a skilled grammarian
* Diligent Reader
* Perpetual Learner
* Instinctive Educator
* Exceptional problem-solver, able to self-teach
* Motivated individual with mental agility to stay in context in an ever-changing environment

As a senior Design Technologist, you will work as a technical leader alongside customer business, development and infrastructure teams. You will facilitate technical and design discussions with IT executives to help enterprises speed their adoption of new technologies and practices, build solutions or prototypes for large customer-facing features, work efficiently and routinely to deliver the right things with limited guidance.
  
  

The role requires the ability to focus on ambiguous problem areas in known or new customer experiences. Proactively identify opportunities and/or problems with product User Experience (UX). For larger prototyping and product integration efforts, you are able to split development work into parallel tasks that can be performed by you and others and then reassembled into a successful prototype launch. Understand the business and technology impact of the experiences you create for customers. You show good judgment and influence trade-offs between desired short-term feature and longer-term product implications of various UX proposals. Stay on top of UX design and technology trends, understanding when to use them and how to adapt them to your product use cases and the scale of the project. You are a key influencer in product strategy. Drive mindful discussions with customers, product managers, other designers, engineers, and stakeholders. You bring perspective and provide context for current technology choices and guide future technology choices. Understand that not all problems are new (or require new software). You make appropriate architectural trade-offs. Your code submissions and approach to work are exemplary – your solutions are inventive, secure, easily maintainable, appropriately scalable, and extensible. You will drive the adoption (and when appropriate, creation) of prototyping tools, frameworks, and platforms. You set standards and drive adherence to quality and design best practices for your team. You work to resolve the root cause of endemic problems including areas where your team limits the innovation of other teams (bottlenecks). This may require you to influence UX and technical design decisions made by other teams. When confronted with discordant views, you are able to find the best way forward and influence others to follow that path (build consensus). You actively recruit and help others leverage your expertise by coaching and mentoring in your organization (or at your location). You contribute to the professional development of colleagues, improving their UX skills, technical knowledge,and engineering practices. Your team is stronger because of your presence, but does not require your presence to be successful.

· Avoiding duplication, confusion and/or overloading those with key subject matter expertise,

· Learnings and best practices from peer institutions and the industry generally, and

As a senior Design Technologist, you will work as a technical leader alongside customer business, development and infrastructure teams. You will facilitate technical and design discussions with IT executives to help enterprises speed their adoption of new technologies and practices, build solutions or prototypes for large customer-facing features, work efficiently and routinely to deliver the right things with limited guidance.
  
  

The role requires the ability to focus on ambiguous problem areas in known or new customer experiences. Proactively identify opportunities and/or problems with product User Experience (UX). For larger prototyping and product integration efforts, you are able to split development work into parallel tasks that can be performed by you and others and then reassembled into a successful prototype launch. Understand the business and technology impact of the experiences you create for customers. You show good judgment and influence trade-offs between desired short-term feature and longer-term product implications of various UX proposals. Stay on top of UX design and technology trends, understanding when to use them and how to adapt them to your product use cases and the scale of the project. You are a key influencer in product strategy. Drive mindful discussions with customers, product managers, other designers, engineers, and stakeholders. You bring perspective and provide context for current technology choices and guide future technology choices. Understand that not all problems are new (or require new software). You make appropriate architectural trade-offs. Your code submissions and approach to work are exemplary – your solutions are inventive, secure, easily maintainable, appropriately scalable, and extensible. You will drive the adoption (and when appropriate, creation) of prototyping tools, frameworks, and platforms. You set standards and drive adherence to quality and design best practices for your team. You work to resolve the root cause of endemic problems including areas where your team limits the innovation of other teams (bottlenecks). This may require you to influence UX and technical design decisions made by other teams. When confronted with discordant views, you are able to find the best way forward and influence others to follow that path (build consensus). You actively recruit and help others leverage your expertise by coaching and mentoring in your organization (or at your location). You contribute to the professional development of colleagues, improving their UX skills, technical knowledge,and engineering practices. Your team is stronger because of your presence, but does not require your presence to be successful.

Would you like to be part of a team that is redefining the IT industry? Amazon Web Services is leading the next paradigm shift in computing and is looking for a world class candidate for the role of Partner Solution Architect/Enterprise Transformation Architect, within our Global Business Consulting & Advisory Partners (BCAP) business function.
  
  

This is an ideal role for someone who has experience working for a management consulting or strategic influencer firm, a large IT consulting firm, or a Fortune 500 company. In this role, you will be responsible for partnering with management consulting or strategic influencer firms where you will develop business and IT transformation strategy for enterprise customers who are embarking on wide-scale adoption of the AWS platform. Working with these large partners is a team effort that will require influence and coordination with many stakeholders at AWS, at the partner firm and with our joint customers at the most senior levels (CIO, CTO, CISO, CPO / CDO).
  
  

Cloud transformation efforts include modernizing applications and delivery models, expanding cloud programs across different business units, and deploying new capabilities (example: robotics, machine learning) to address business needs. Customer’s business and IT teams embracing technology shifts (example: move from on-premise to SaaS, moving from waterfall to agile, rearchitecting from monolithic to microservices) require changes in their governance models, new skills, and evolved organization structures. Enterprise customers ask AWS to provide guidance on people, process aspects in addition to technology (example: “How should I structure my organization?”, “What kinds of roles will I need?”, “Can you help me build a DevOps organization?”, “I am bought into AWS, now how do I accelerate migrations to AWS aligned with my established enterprise standards”).
  
  

Enterprise Transformation Architects come from a background of 1) having extensive experience in influencing (driving) transformation efforts with business and IT leaders and executive teams; 2) a deep technical background (example: understanding of IT portfolios, enterprise platforms, enterprise architectures); and 3) a strong understanding of risk, compliance and security. Through our partner firms, you will engage with customers in a pre-sales capacity, analyze their capabilities along seven key pillars: People, Business, Governance, Application Development, Operations, Platform and Security and provide assessments with detailed results of the analysis. You will not only earn ‘trusted advisor’ status with influencer firm Managing Partners, but also our joint customer’s executive staff (CIO, CTO), devising a long-term roadmap and plan of action to cultivate the desired capabilities to evolve the organization, positioning AWS professional services and/or APN partners to help deliver on the desired capabilities. Results for the customer will be a vision that increases their ability to innovate on the AWS platform, by modernizing their people-skills, process and technology footprint and accelerating the incorporation of the AWS platform. Enterprise Transformation Architects are responsible for contributing to the best practices from enterprise transformations that have positively impacted our customers’ business agility, helping build reusable assets and tools to help scale the function globally within the AWS SA team. Lastly, they provide thought leadership by publishing content and delivering sessions on Enterprise Transformation at AWS and Enterprise events.

Vermillio is the first - and only - generative AI platform that empowers creators to unlock their  
potential and protect their work using Authenticated AI. Using our platform, artists, studios, and  
intellectual property owners can track and authenticate generative AI as well as the use of their  
work by others in order to receive fair credit and compensation. Exercising control over their IP  
even as it is transformed by AI, creators large and small can engage directly with their fans,  
quickly and easily.  
  
Our goal is twofold: to put creators in control of their own AI-generated content, ensuring that  
they are fairly credited and compensated for their work; and to give fans access to the best  
possible experience as they engage with content from their favorite artists, creators, and IP  
holders.

With Vermillio, creators can quickly and easily generate new fan experiences – all while making  
sure that they own and are paid for their AI-created content. We're changing the way people  
generate and experience content... and we're just getting started.

Vermillio is led by a proven team of technologists with 100+ years of collective experience  
building AI software and scaled transaction systems. We are at the forefront of the industry,  
collaborating and working with prominent thought leaders, artists and the rights holders of the  
world’s most loved IP to develop immersive AI-generated content experiences.

As generative AI transforms the creator economy, it is our intention to help inspire, support and  
facilitate the content of the future. Our AI-powered tools generate content that is authenticated  
using our proprietary Trace technology which determines ownership.

EvenUp operates across a variety of personal injury cases, including motor vehicle accidents and negligence claims.
