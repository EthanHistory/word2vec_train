I am seeking to work with a seasoned computer scientist with an entrepreneurial mindset!

This opportunity entails working on a 13 year old project known as Desktop Cloud! Desktop Cloud should be considered THE CLOUD due to its structural design principles and very amazing code structure! Desktop Cloud is a website interfaced OS which mimics a window like GUI that’s built on its on proprietary file hierarchy & manager just like Microsoft Windows but much better, safer & faster! The organization is unmatched due to the Master Database logic which also includes a multi threaded engine system! Nothing about Desktop Cloud is static and the entire motto of its belief system is “We Build Things That Build Things” not a single minute is wasted attempting to build a function that doesn’t have an evolutional effect in mind! Hierarchical infrastructure is always the prioritized mindset when drafting all coding blueprints!

IDE: Visual Studio

Coding Languages: MVC/C#/JSON/Javascript/jQuery/AJAX/XML/HTML/MS-SQL/API’s//PHP/Asterisk/Power-shell

Desktop Cloud is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping Democratize the international community safeguarding the effects of the obvious technology explosion very soon to replace the bulk of the people’s jobs! The right person for this job won’t be seeking to become a millionaire and is more concerned about the people of the world than trying to compete in the current market system which is already so monopolistic and designed select on a few lucky winners and the rest are pre decided to work under the umbrella of capitalism! I don’t have the budget to offer a salary right off but the moment we get it back online I have more than enough resources who will be willing to fund its mission and maybe even the one reading this would be in the right position to be par with the same considerations! Let’s discuss all potential options and draw up a fair and honorable agreement and get this started immediately!

**Important Notice:**

At Integra Connect, we are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our job applicants. Unfortunately, scammers may attempt to impersonate our company to deceive individuals seeking employment. We take this matter seriously and want to ensure your job search with us is free from any fraudulent activity.

Integra Connect has become aware of recent, fraudulent recruitment activity being conducted by individuals or groups who claim to be third party recruiters and/or points of contact for our Company. Examples include sending candidates a request for personal information, conducting online interviews or meetings, making offers of employment, demanding money for employment related services and activities, or asking the applicant to purchase a laptop or other work-related equipment for the job. The aim of the fraud is to obtain personally identifying information (*e.g*., identity theft) and/or money. The Company’s name, as well as the names of employees, are used to try to convey authenticity.

Here are some tips to help you identify and avoid job scams:

1. Always Check the Source:

Ensure that the job listing is on our official website or a reputable job board. Our official domain is https://www.integraconnect.com/resources/careers/. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media messages offering job opportunities.

2. Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information:

We will never request sensitive personal information like your Social Security number, bank details, or payment for onboarding/equipment. If you encounter such requests, it's likely a scam.

3. Verify Contact Information:

Check that the contact information provided in the job posting, including email addresses and phone numbers, aligns with our official contact information. Scammers often use generic or non-company email addresses.

* What is the sender’s email address? Is it consistent with other job postings from this company? Email addresses that are slightly different from any business’s primary contact information (“Jane.Doe@IntegraConnect.org” vs “John.Doe@Integra Connect.com”) are a common warning sign.
* If you are contacted through LinkedIn, be sure to review the entire profile to verify their credentials.

If you suspect that a job offer is fraudulent, we recommend that you do not respond to it.

If you believe you are the victim of any fraudulent activity, you can report it to the appropriate authorities at https://www.myfloridalegal.com/consumer-protection/how-to-protect-yourself-job-listing-and-job-search-firms (Florida Department of State) and/or https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams#report (U.S. Federal Trade Commission).

Integra Connect is not responsible for any fraudulent offers and advises prospective candidates to follow the guidance provided above.

Thank you for your interest in a career with Integra Connect. We look forward to connecting with genuine, talented individuals like you.

**About SV Camp:**SV Camp is a technical bootcamp designed to bridge the gap between traditional academic education and the practical, real-world demands of the tech industry. The program recognizes a common issue faced by many graduates: the skills taught in universities, while valuable, often do not translate directly into the hands-on expertise that employers are looking for. As a result, even well-educated individuals may find it challenging to secure jobs in the competitive tech market.SV Camp aims to resolve this discrepancy by offering a curriculum that emphasizes real-life scenarios and projects, closely mirroring the tasks and challenges professionals face in the tech industry. This hands-on approach ensures that students not only learn theoretical concepts but also apply them in practical settings, thereby gaining the experience and skills that are immediately applicable to their careers.The bootcamp is likely to include components such as coding projects, team collaborations, and perhaps internships or mentorships with tech companies, providing a comprehensive education that covers both the technical skills and the soft skills (like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving) that are crucial in the workplace.By focusing on these areas, SV Camp aims to produce graduates who are not just knowledgeable, but also ready to contribute effectively in their roles from day one, making them highly attractive to potential employers.",,,,,,,,,,,,Software Engineer,2024-04-17
