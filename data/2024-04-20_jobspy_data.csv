We are a group of passionate technology professionals who are committed to delivering best-in-class software solutions for the non-profit space. We care deeply about our clients’ needs and understand that the work we do has a direct impact on their ability to continue improving the lives of many different people and groups. We develop in .NET (Full Framework & Core C#), Angular, SQL, and anything else we need to in order to get the job done correctly and quickly.

**About The Job**

The Software Developer is responsible for all aspects of the development and delivery of our applications. You should possess most or all of the following skills:

* Understand how to develop and enforce coding standards and source code development standards
* Design and develop code that is clean, understandable, maintainable, and SOLID
* Design, develop and implement test plans to accurately test the application code, functions, modules and program
* Develop and maintain detailed and accurate documentation per all project standards

**About You**

We are looking for individuals who love building software. You should have experience, but also be willing to stretch and learn new things.

* You keep your skills up to date. You recognize the importance of spending time with different technologies in order to make the correct decisions on what you will use in your next project.
* You consider yourself above average in your knowledge of .NET and know what has changed and what will be changing next.

* JavaScript is just fine. You also try to keep up on new tools/frameworks (Node, Angular, Vue, React/Redux/Mobx, RxJS, etc.)
* SQL isn’t just for DBAs. It is important that Software Developers know how to write and tune their scripts.
* You can communicate clearly both in-person and through written mediums.
* Testing your code has saved the day on many occasions.

**About SV Camp:**SV Camp is a technical bootcamp designed to bridge the gap between traditional academic education and the practical, real-world demands of the tech industry. The program recognizes a common issue faced by many graduates: the skills taught in universities, while valuable, often do not translate directly into the hands-on expertise that employers are looking for. As a result, even well-educated individuals may find it challenging to secure jobs in the competitive tech market.SV Camp aims to resolve this discrepancy by offering a curriculum that emphasizes real-life scenarios and projects, closely mirroring the tasks and challenges professionals face in the tech industry. This hands-on approach ensures that students not only learn theoretical concepts but also apply them in practical settings, thereby gaining the experience and skills that are immediately applicable to their careers.The bootcamp is likely to include components such as coding projects, team collaborations, and perhaps internships or mentorships with tech companies, providing a comprehensive education that covers both the technical skills and the soft skills (like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving) that are crucial in the workplace.By focusing on these areas, SV Camp aims to produce graduates who are not just knowledgeable, but also ready to contribute effectively in their roles from day one, making them highly attractive to potential employers.",,,,,,,,,,,,Software Engineer,2024-04-20
